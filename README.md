# Triton Kernel Programming Notes

With some GPU programming under my belt and quite a lot of Machine Learning
experience, I was curious to learn more about both as well as tackle the Triton
Language.

At the moment, all of the code is from Tunadorable's 
[Triton Kernel Programming Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPefVKO3tDxOJLAmCA75uShbe1z_RNqkQ).

### Currently implemented:

- [x] Simple Addition

- [x] Fused SoftMax

Neither of these are currently well-described or documented, however, the 
implementation themselves match performance with Torch's underlying methods.

### TODO
- [ ] Implement More Algorithms
- [ ] Improve documentation and notes
